## I was interested in 

1. applied econometrics/evaluation of public policies
1. labor economics/economics of education
1. political economy
1. ... 

## Sources of inspiration 

* Joshua Angrist : IV models, etc
* Charles Manski : *Identification problems for the social sciences*
* Eric Maurin : 
* Andrew Gelman : 
* Gary King : developing statistical methodes but also software !

## My research

## Teaching was a great experience

* I've been teaching at Cachan : 
* econometrics
* statistics
* game theory
* decision theory
* growth theory
* It's a great experience

## Why did I not finished py Phd ?

* too curious, not enough focus.
* without deadline, procrastination can be infinite !
* isolation : I wanted to learn by myself, instead of asking others.

## 3 tips for not giving up your doctorate

* stay focus on your research/papers. Don't be too curious.
* learn from others/ don't try to learn everything by yourself
* do things you can do. Don't try to do what you can't do.

# There is a life out of the lab

Econometrics use data but around 2012, many other fields use data :

* emerging field of data science / data in the business life 
* data journalism
* open data : civic use of data

## How to find a job when you leave research

* Attend meetups : data tuesdays
* Attend hackathons/open data camps 
* Participate to non profit organization : Open knowledge foundation
* Write emails to interesting people and meet them

## The data governance report 

<p class="double">
### 3 axes for data policy

* producing high quality key datasets
* improving data flow while respecting confidentiality
* using data to improve public action

<img src="images/couv-rapport-agd-20162017.png">
</p>

## What are our ways of acting?

1. **maker way** : develop products and tools
1. **legal way** : drafting the law, defining a policy
1. **people way** : supporting public administration and working with the civil society

## Producing high quality key datasets

Giving  legal recognition to « reference data » (Digital Republic Act, 2016) 

9 key datasets that are critical for the society and economy, including :
  
* Company Register (Sirene),
* Land Register (Cadastre),
* National adresses database,
* National directory of associations

## Improving data flow
  
### Legal way
  
* *Free access to public data has now become the rule*. Exceptions to this principle are now very strictly regulated.  
* The Digital Republic Act (2016) has considerably expanded the range of administrative documents available online, moving from release on demand to *open data by default* (effective in 2018)
